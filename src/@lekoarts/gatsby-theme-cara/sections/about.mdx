## About

> I'm an autodidactic Software Developer, experienced in JavaScript (React.js, Redux, Node, D3), Ruby on Rails, SQL, Git, HTML5, CSS3, and more.  I currently work as a Software Developer and Support Engineer (and sometime Devops and PM) to support internal tools; It's awesome. 

Before that for several years I worked with a team of software engineers to design the robotics component of a coding studio for an art and technology education program. I have built several projects including a clone of Asana, using Ruby on Rails, and a gamified data visualization of Wikipedia links using D3 and Vanilla js.
